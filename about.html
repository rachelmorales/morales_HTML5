    <p>iMask is a revolutionary invention and will keep you safe from the Covid-19 deadly virus. We want our customers to feel confident in the safety of their lives when wearing our product. As technologies advance, Apple wants to design an ear
      piece iMask that will hug your ear and unfold over your nose and mouth as a protective mask when activated. This iMask would only need to be charged once a week. This ear piece creates a hands free protection that wonâ€™t get in the way of our
      daily
      activities. We will call it the iMask PostHuman. This will change the way of life as we know it as we as a society try and adopt new ways of living during the pandemic. This will bring us closer than ever with our technologies that we rely on
      everyday.</p>
